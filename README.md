# Description

Add missing useful String extension method to Pharo String class.

# Installation

## Install from CLI

Install **StringExtensions** from Command-Line Interface using [Pharo Install](https://github.com/hernanmd/pi):

```bash
pi install StringExtensions
```

## Install from Pharo

```smalltalk
EpMonitor disableDuring: [ 
	Metacello new
		baseline: 'StringExtensions';
		repository: 'github://hernanmd/StringExtensions/repository';
		load ]
```

## Baseline Snippet

If you want to add the ProjectFramework to your Metacello Baselines or Configurations, copy and paste the following expression:

```smalltalk
	" ... "
		baseline: 'StringExtensions' 
		with: [ spec repository: 'github://hernanmd/StringExtensions/repository' ].
	" ... "
```

# Details

To quickly find methods provided by this package, please evaluate:

## Extraction Methods

### findNumbers

Extracting numbers in Strings is easily supported in Pharo:

```smalltalk
'Hola123Mundo' asInteger. "123"
```

However, consider the following:

```smalltalk
'Hola123Mundo234' asInteger. "123"
```

If we want to extract all numbers in the received **String**, then we could use #findNumbers:

```smalltalk
'Hola123Mundo234'  "an OrderedCollection('123' '234')"
```

- On empty **String**, answer an empty **Collection**
- Negative Integers are extracted with sign: `'Hola-10' findNumbers. "an OrderedCollection('-10')"`
- Floats are not supported: `'Hola30.6' findNumbers.  "an OrderedCollection('30' '6')"`

### withoutBlanks

Return a copy of the receiver with leading/trailing blanks removed and white spaces condensed.

### withoutNumbers

Reject all digits from the received **String**. Examples:

```smalltalk
'3333' withoutNumbers = ''.

'aaaa' withoutNumbers = 'aaaa'.

'aaa1234' withoutNumbers = 'aaa'.

'' withoutNumbers = ''
```

## Conversion Methods

### asCondensedString

Return a copy of the receiver with leading/trailing blanks removed and white spaces condensed.

### withoutCRs

Return a copy of the receiver without carriage returns.

## Testing Methods

### includesBeginWith:

Answer whether the parameter **String** begins like one of the receiver's sub strings elements. For example, the following expressions evaluate all to *true*:

```smalltalk
'Rose is a rose of splendor' includesBeginWith: 'rose'.

'Rose is a rose of splendor' includesBeginWith: 'ROSE'.

'Raise the art to resistance' includesBeginWith: 'resist'.

'Danger dare to be grand' includesBeginWith: 'dar'.
```

### isAllLetters

Answer *true* whether the receiver is composed entirely of letters.

### isNumeric

Answer whether the receiver is a **Number**. It uses a regular expression. 

### isXML

Cheap checking of beggining XML document, no parsing involved, just check '<?xml'.

### isZipped

Uses **GZipConstants** gzipMagic to check if the received **String** conforms to GZip file format.
